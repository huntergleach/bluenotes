        <i>Hunter Leach, Creative (new) Developer.</i>
        <br>
        <br>
        I've always been a tinkerer. I think it comes from my dad. Growing up, he always had a project going. 
        Anything from building a new PC, to repairing our cars, to even taking my old toys apart to figure out how they worked.
        That curiosity is something that came early and stayed late in my life. 
        I've never cared so much about what was happening in front of me as opposed to <i>why</i> it was happening. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Along with being a curious kid, I picked up the drums at 12 and guitar at 13. Now I was a <i>LOUD</i> and curious kid, 
        luckily with incredibly supporting parents.
        Music opened my eyes to the world in a new way, because now <i>I</i> could create what <i>I</i> wanted to listen to. 
        It gave me a sense of agency and identity I hadn't previously had, with seemingly endless possibilites.
        <br>

        The same applies to writing code. It's a lanuage, like music, with many different ways to express 
        whatever it is you'd like to express. There are rules of course, just like music, 
        but the possibilites are still seemingly endless.
        I am incredibly excited to be stepping into this new field. The promise of 
        learning what goes on under the hood of my everyday life is a fascinating prospect, and I'm hungry to 
        satify some more curiosity.
